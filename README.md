 + UX: MIUI 13
 + Chipset: Mediatek Helio G85 @ 12nm
 + Processor: Octacore (2x Cortex-A75 @ 2GHz / 6x Cortex-A55 @ 1.8GHz)

- Notes:
  + Before MIUI 13 (MIUI 12.5//11):
    * Nice phone, according to price, isn't so bad, maybe a nice choice.
  + After MIUI 13:
    * Or the update is an a*s, or my phone is an a*s but godd*mn this update, is worst as f*ck.
    * This phone is a warrior, extreme use, a worst update, a messy memory management, 70+ hard resets, 2 years, and still is alive.
